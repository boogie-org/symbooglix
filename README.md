Symboolix
=========

The Symbolic execution engine for Boogie

Getting started
===============

We use git-remote-hg [1] so we can treat the Mercurial Boogie repository 
just like a Git repository. Make sure it's installed before you start.

We use Git's submodule feature for the Boogie folder. To set things up
run...

```
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```
